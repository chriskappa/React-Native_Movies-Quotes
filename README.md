# Project Plan for "Favourite Movie Quote List" Application

After receiving the project instructions, I did plan what  libraries and APIs will be optimal for the development of Movie Quote Application. My primary focus was on ensuring application efficiency and optimization, alongside maintaining clean code practices and an intuitive UI design. To uphold the principles of efficient coding, I followed the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding principle, ensuring that the codebase and components were modular. For this application I have used real APIs for the seamless fetching and posting of movie quotes to the database.

# Execution Strategy

### Enhancing Efficiency and Optimization

In pursuit of maximum efficiency and application responsiveness, I employed best coding practices tailored for React Native. This included the strategic use of `useCallback`, `memo`, `useMemo`, and custom debouncing techniques to minimize unnecessary renders and optimize performance.Additionally, for handling large datasets more efficiently, the `FlatList` component was utilized to ensure smooth scrolling and enhanced performance, given its optimized handling of list items and lazy loading capabilities.

### Emphasizing Modularity

To facilitate future enhancements and maintainability, I have structured the project' designed with modularity in mind. By adopting a clear folder organization and encapsulating functionality into hooks, the codebase remains organized and scalable. Components are designed to be reusable, allowing for easy reusability if we would like to add more futures to the existing application.
