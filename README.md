# Execution Strategy

### Enhancing Efficiency and Optimization

In pursuit of maximum efficiency and application responsiveness, I employed best coding practices tailored for React Native. This included the strategic use of `useCallback`, `memo`, `useMemo`, and custom debouncing techniques to minimize unnecessary renders and optimize performance.Additionally, for handling large datasets more efficiently, the `FlatList` component was utilized to ensure smooth scrolling and enhanced performance, given its optimized handling of list items and lazy loading capabilities.

### Emphasizing Modularity

To facilitate future enhancements and maintainability, I have structured the project' designed with modularity in mind. By adopting a clear folder organization and encapsulating functionality into hooks, the codebase remains organized and scalable. Components are designed to be reusable, allowing for easy reusability if we would like to add more futures to the existing application.
